1-PROJECT DESCRIPTION

In this assignment, we were tasked with creating and manipulating Pandas DataFrames in Jupyter Notebooks to analyze school and standardized test data. 

The contextual purpose of the analysis was to use data science to help a hypothetical school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities in a particular school district. The measure of success for schools is high scores in math and reading on district-wide standardized tests, and passing rates on those same tests. Test results data was examined in light of information on local schools, including school size, budget, and type to discover patterns that may contribute to the success of schools in promoting high test scores and passing rates.

After providing aggregate metrics for the school district, the analysis showed tabulations of schools by type, size, budget, and student test scores and passing rates in math and reading. The best and worst performing schools by passing rates were isolated and test performance by school was expanded to review results across grades. The most policy-relevant part of the analysis came at the end, where scores were provided according to school spending, size, and type.

OBSERVATIONS FROM THE ANALYSIS ARE PROVIDED AT THE TOP OF THE JUPYTER NOTEBOOK FILE

2-INSTALLATION

This project is coded in Python 3.10.9
The analysis file has an .ipynb extension, so it's meant to be viewed in Jupyter Notebook.

Data files -
    schools_complete.csv,
    students_complete.csv

Dependencies -
    pandas,
    pathlib.Path

-- Note: This project assumes the two source .csv files listed above retain their original names and are in a folder labeled "Resources" that is one level below where the Python file resides. If you do not follow this relative placement of the elements,  the the program will not run and the path will need to be updated.
